# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

ðŸš€ An end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and drive sustainability-focused marketing campaigns.

## Project Goals
- Build a robust pipeline from data to actionable insights
- Identify high-value eco-conscious customers
- Automate personalized marketing campaigns

## Data Source
Synthetic data will be generated to simulate realistic customer behaviors, purchase patterns, and sustainability engagement. This allows experimentation without using sensitive real data.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Core modules for data processing, modeling, segmentation, and automation
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis and prototyping
- `scripts/`: Scripts to run training and campaign execution
- `tests/`: Unit tests for code quality and reproducibility
- `data/`: Raw, processed, and synthetic data storage
- `docs/`: Project documentation and methodology
- `config/`: Configuration files for models and campaigns

## Next Steps
- Generate synthetic data using `src/data/generator.py`
- Process data and engineer features
- Train prediction models
- Segment customers and run campaigns
