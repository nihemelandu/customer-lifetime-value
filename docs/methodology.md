# Problem Definition & Scoping

## 1.1 Original Business Problem Statement

**Stakeholder:** VP of Marketing & Customer Retention  
**Date:** 04/01/2025  
**Urgency:** High â€” Impacts customer lifetime value, retention, and campaign ROI

**Original Problem Description:**  
> "Retention rates for mid- and high-value customer segments are declining. We need a data-driven method to identify churn risks earlier and test the potential impact of personalized engagement strategies before launching new campaigns."

---

## 1.2 Problem Decomposition

This retention issue breaks down into several interrelated challenges that affect both revenue and marketing efficiency:

### A. Declining Retention in High-Value Segments  
- **Core Problem:** Traditional segmentation and outreach methods fail to retain profitable customers  
- **Impact:** Revenue leakage due to customer churn among high-LTV users  
- **Measurable Aspect:** Retention rate changes by segment, lost CLV over time

### B. Lack of Early Churn Detection  
- **Core Problem:** No reliable indicators or model currently in place to proactively flag churn risk  
- **Impact:** Missed opportunities for timely intervention and retention  
- **Measurable Aspect:** Lead time between risk detection and actual churn, churn prediction accuracy (e.g., AUC, recall)

### C. Ineffective Personalization Strategy Testing  
- **Core Problem:** Personalized marketing content is not tested systematically prior to rollout  
- **Impact:** Budget waste on ineffective campaigns and missed ROI optimization  
- **Measurable Aspect:** Simulated vs. actual performance of messaging strategies, projected ROI

## 1.3 Problem Prioritization

Prioritized based on revenue impact, data readiness, and actionability:

| Priority | Area                            | Reason                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Early Churn Detection            | High business value in proactive retention of high-LTV customers       |
| 2        | Campaign Simulation & ROI        | Enables informed investment decisions before campaign execution        |
| 3        | Retention Strategy Personalization | Increases relevance and impact of outreach to improve engagement rates |

## 1.4 Focused Problem Statement

**Primary Focus:**  
Predict churn risk in mid- and high-value customer segments and simulate personalized retention strategies to improve lifetime value and marketing ROI.

**Specific Problem Definition:**  
"Develop a data-driven framework to identify behavioral indicators of churn among high-value customers, predict customer lifetime value, and simulate the impact of personalized messaging strategies to guide campaign investment decisions."

## 1.6 Scope Definition

### âœ… In Scope  
- Understanding declining retention patterns in mid- and high-value customer segments  
- Analyzing customer behavioral data to identify indicators of churn  
- Estimating customer lifetime value (CLV) to prioritize retention focus  
- Segmenting customers based on predicted churn risk and value  
- Exploring how variations in engagement strategies may affect retention and repeat purchase behavior  
- Estimating potential business impact of targeted engagement strategies (e.g., CLV uplift, repeat purchase rate, ROI)

### ðŸš« Out of Scope  
- Implementation of live or real-time personalization systems  
- Execution of actual marketing campaigns or A/B testing in production  
- Changes to pricing, loyalty programs, or core product offerings  
- Adjustments to customer service workflows or support infrastructure  
- Integration with third-party campaign platforms or customer data platforms

---

## 1.7 Assumptions & Constraints

**Assumptions:**  
- Sufficient historical customer data exists, including transactions, engagement, and marketing interactions  
- Churn is detectable through behavioral patterns within available data  
- Stakeholders will use simulation outputs to inform campaign design  
- CLV and churn models are updated regularly to reflect changing patterns

**Constraints:**  
- Limited labeled churn outcomes may reduce supervised learning performance  
- Marketing and product changes during the project may introduce noise in modeling  
- Must use existing customer and campaign data infrastructure  
- Messaging simulations are based on past behavior, not real-world experimentation

## 1.8 Stakeholder Alignment

**Primary Stakeholders:**  
- VP of Marketing & Customer Retention (Problem Owner)  
- CRM & Email Campaign Team  
- Customer Analytics and Insights Team  
- Data Science & Engineering Team  
- Customer Success & Strategy Leadership  

**Success Validation Process:**  
- Model accuracy review by Week 4  
- Simulation framework review and approval by Week 6  
- Results integration into campaign planning by Week 8  
- ROI validation from actual campaign data by Week 12 (post-simulation deployment)

**Communication Plan:**  
- Weekly syncs with analytics and campaign planning teams  
- Bi-weekly readouts with VP of Marketing  
- Monthly executive updates on retention insights and projected ROI

## 1.9 Problem Translation to DS/ML Task

The business problem was translated into two core machine learning tasks, with a supporting simulation component to assess impact before campaign execution.

### ðŸ”¹ ML Task 1: Predict Churn Risk

- **Type:** Supervised classification
- **Goal:** Predict the likelihood that a high- or mid-value customer will churn.
- **Target Variable:** `churn_label` (binary: 1 = churn, 0 = retained), based on no purchase within a defined inactivity window (e.g., 90 days).
- **Input Features:** Purchase recency and frequency, product views, email engagement, loyalty tier, customer tenure, previous campaign responses.
- **Business Use:** Identify at-risk customers early for proactive retention strategies.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** ROC AUC, recall for high-value churners, precision@k (for targeting efficiency).

### ðŸ”¹ ML Task 2: Predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

- **Type:** Supervised regression
- **Goal:** Estimate expected future revenue from each customer.
- **Target Variable:** `CLV` (continuous), calculated based on historical revenue and projected behavior.
- **Input Features:** Historical transactions, average order value, frequency, response to past campaigns, browsing behavior, and segment attributes.
- **Business Use:** Prioritize customers by value to guide messaging intensity and investment.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAPE, relative error margin (â‰¤15%).

### ðŸ”¸ Supporting Task: Campaign Simulation

- **Type:** What-if analysis / business simulation
- **Goal:** Estimate the potential uplift from personalized messaging strategies before campaign execution.
- **Method:** Use model-predicted churn and CLV scores to simulate targeted engagement vs. control scenarios.
- **Expected Outcome:** Quantify impact in terms of CLV uplift, repeat purchases, and ROI before real-world rollout.

### ðŸ§© Assumptions

- Churn and CLV are both labelable from historical behavior with sufficient accuracy.
- Past behavioral patterns are predictive of future churn and spending.
- Simulated outcomes from the models can guide campaign design with business-relevant accuracy.
