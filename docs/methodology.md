# Problem Definition & Scoping

## 1.1 Original Business Problem Statement

**Stakeholder:** VP of Marketing & Customer Retention  
**Date:** 04/01/2025  
**Urgency:** High â€” Impacts customer lifetime value, retention, and campaign ROI

**Original Problem Description:**  
> "Retention rates for mid- and high-value customer segments are declining. We need a data-driven method to identify churn risks earlier and test the potential impact of personalized engagement strategies before launching new campaigns."

---

## 1.2 Problem Decomposition

This retention issue breaks down into several interrelated challenges that affect both revenue and marketing efficiency:

### A. Declining Retention in High-Value Segments  
- **Core Problem:** Traditional segmentation and outreach methods fail to retain profitable customers  
- **Impact:** Revenue leakage due to customer churn among high-LTV users  
- **Measurable Aspect:** Retention rate changes by segment, lost CLV over time

### B. Lack of Early Churn Detection  
- **Core Problem:** No reliable indicators or model currently in place to proactively flag churn risk  
- **Impact:** Missed opportunities for timely intervention and retention  
- **Measurable Aspect:** Lead time between risk detection and actual churn, churn prediction accuracy (e.g., AUC, recall)

### C. Ineffective Personalization Strategy Testing  
- **Core Problem:** Personalized marketing content is not tested systematically prior to rollout  
- **Impact:** Budget waste on ineffective campaigns and missed ROI optimization  
- **Measurable Aspect:** Simulated vs. actual performance of messaging strategies, projected ROI

## 1.3 Problem Prioritization

Prioritized based on revenue impact, data readiness, and actionability:

| Priority | Area                            | Reason                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Early Churn Detection            | High business value in proactive retention of high-LTV customers       |
| 2        | Campaign Simulation & ROI        | Enables informed investment decisions before campaign execution        |
| 3        | Retention Strategy Personalization | Increases relevance and impact of outreach to improve engagement rates |

## 1.4 Focused Problem Statement

**Primary Focus:**  
Predict churn risk in mid- and high-value customer segments and simulate personalized retention strategies to improve lifetime value and marketing ROI.

**Specific Problem Definition:**  
"Develop a data-driven framework to identify behavioral indicators of churn among high-value customers, predict customer lifetime value, and simulate the impact of personalized messaging strategies to guide campaign investment decisions."

## 1.5 Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metrics:**  
- **Churn Prediction Performance:** ROC AUC â‰¥ 0.80, recall â‰¥ 70% for high-value churners  
- **CLV Prediction Accuracy:** â‰¤15% error margin for predicted vs. actual CLV  
- **Simulated Uplift:** Projected CLV uplift â‰¥ 20% from targeted messaging  
- **Campaign ROI Impact:** 3Ã— ROI from targeted marketing strategies

**Secondary Success Metrics:**  
- **Retention Rate Improvement:** â‰¥10% uplift in retention for mid/high-value segments  
- **Repeat Purchase Rate:** â‰¥25% increase among intervention groups  
- **Behavioral Signal Utility:** Improved lead time between churn risk detection and customer drop-off

## 1.6 Scope Definition

### âœ… In Scope  
- Understanding declining retention patterns in mid- and high-value customer segments  
- Analyzing customer behavioral data to identify indicators of churn  
- Estimating customer lifetime value (CLV) to prioritize retention focus  
- Segmenting customers based on predicted churn risk and value  
- Exploring how variations in engagement strategies may affect retention and repeat purchase behavior  
- Estimating potential business impact of targeted engagement strategies (e.g., CLV uplift, repeat purchase rate, ROI)

### ðŸš« Out of Scope  
- Implementation of live or real-time personalization systems  
- Execution of actual marketing campaigns or A/B testing in production  
- Changes to pricing, loyalty programs, or core product offerings  
- Adjustments to customer service workflows or support infrastructure  
- Integration with third-party campaign platforms or customer data platforms

---

## 1.7 Assumptions & Constraints

**Assumptions:**  
- Sufficient historical customer data exists, including transactions, engagement, and marketing interactions  
- Churn is detectable through behavioral patterns within available data  
- Stakeholders will use simulation outputs to inform campaign design  
- CLV and churn models are updated regularly to reflect changing patterns

**Constraints:**  
- Limited labeled churn outcomes may reduce supervised learning performance  
- Marketing and product changes during the project may introduce noise in modeling  
- Must use existing customer and campaign data infrastructure  
- Messaging simulations are based on past behavior, not real-world experimentation

## 1.8 Stakeholder Alignment

**Primary Stakeholders:**  
- VP of Marketing & Customer Retention (Problem Owner)  
- CRM & Email Campaign Team  
- Customer Analytics and Insights Team  
- Data Science & Engineering Team  
- Customer Success & Strategy Leadership  

**Success Validation Process:**
